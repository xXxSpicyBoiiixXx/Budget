Budget Application in C

### Background 
Coming from a low level background, I noticed many budget applications were in the form of javascript, ruby, and other higher level languages. So, with all my stubborness I wanted to make a budget application in C that was inspired to have a management system for my personal budget starting in 2024. Feel free to fork this if needed as I'm more than happy to share code :) 

*** This is currently under construction as I've only taken an intial stab at this ***
